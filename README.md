This repo contains demos of Elix components used in Preact applications.

# Install

1. `npm update -g npm`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`

You should then be able to open your browser to http://0.0.0.0:8080.

At the moment, these demos do not work with the polyfills, and require native
Shadow DOM and Custom Elements support.
